Some small shabby snippets for Common Lisp using the Emacs yasnippets package.

Check out into or link to:
~/.emacs.d/snippets/lisp-mode/

I obviously haven't included everything in Common Lisp, only the things that
are hard for me to remember or very common and long.

Generally, there are two styles of expansion, one where you've already typed
the starting paren, and one where the expansion will put it in for you.

- Starting paren already typed:

  (defclass<TAB>

will expand to:

  (defclass name (superclasses) ...)

- Starting paren included:

  (defclass foo (bar)
    (slot<TAB>)
    (:documentation "A foo for you."))

will put the paren in for you:

  (defclass foo (bar)
    ((slot-name :initarg slot-name :accessor ...))
    (:documentation "A foo for you."))

Enjoy your bubble popping.
