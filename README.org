Some small shabby snippets for Common Lisp using the Emacs yasnippets package.

Check out into or link to:
[[~/.emacs.d/snippets/lisp-mode/]]

I obviously haven't included everything in Common Lisp, only the things that
are hard for me to remember or very common and long.

Generally, there are two styles of expansion, one where you've already typed
the starting paren, and one where the expansion will put it in for you.

- Starting paren already typed:

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (defclass<TAB>
#+END_SRC

will expand to:

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (defclass name (superclasses) ...)
#+END_SRC

- Starting paren included:

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (defclass foo (bar)
    (slot<TAB>)
    (:documentation "A foo for you."))
#+END_SRC

will put the paren in for you:

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (defclass foo (bar)
    ((slot-name :initarg slot-name :accessor ...))
    (:documentation "A foo for you."))
#+END_SRC

Enjoy your bubble popping.
